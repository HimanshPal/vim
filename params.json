I use default for almost everything. The only major modification is the addition of NERDTree. It is mostly Python centric, because that is what I use most of the time. \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git://github.com/Apreche/vim.git\r\nmv vim ~/.vim\r\ncd ~/.vim\r\ngit submodule init\r\ngit submodule update\r\nln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc\r\n```","tagline":"My personal vim configuration directory.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
